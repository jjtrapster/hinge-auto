"""Configuration for HingeAuto.

PREFERENCES, AGE_MIN/MAX, and MESSAGE_VOICE come from the active mode (see
`modes/`). Set ACTIVE_MODE here for the persistent default; override per-run
via `python main.py --mode <name>`.

The COORDS defaults below are calibrated for a 1080x2424 Pixel (10, or 9
non-Pro) — emulator or real phone. If that's what you're running and Hinge
hasn't shifted its layout, they should work as-is. Otherwise run
`python calibrate.py` and update the values that don't match your device.

# ---------- Run mode ----------
# DRY_RUN = False -> actually like / send messages (default)
# DRY_RUN = True  -> decide and log, but force-skip every profile
#                    instead of liking. Every "would-like" profile gets
#                    skipped (gone from your queue) but no likes are
#                    spent.
#
# When to flip this to True:
#   - Free Hinge (8 likes/day): YES, for your first run or two. Lets
#     you watch decisions without spending your daily cap on a rubric
#     you haven't tuned. Once decisions look right, flip back to False.
#   - Hinge+ (unlimited likes): NO. Just run small live batches
#     (MAX_LIKES_PER_SESSION = 5) and Ctrl-C if something looks off.
DRY_RUN = False

# Default = 8, which matches free-tier Hinge's daily like cap (resets at
# 4am local). One session per day exhausts the free allotment cleanly.
#
# If you have Hinge+ (no daily cap), bump this to ~25-50 per session and
# run multiple sessions throughout the day. Going much higher per session
# tends to trigger Hinge's soft-throttle (empty Discover after a burst);
# spacing batches across the day works better than one giant batch.

# ---------- Device settings ----------
# Pixel 10 (and recent non-Pro Pixels) are 1080x2424. main.py reads the
# real size from the device at startup (`adb shell wm size`) and warns if
# it differs. Change these to match your phone and re-run calibrate.py.
